							<p>Internet is a network communication system that allows devices to connect to each other globally. As the internet has become faster and more advanced, the internet accessibility has increased dramatically and the internet-based industries such as eBay and Facebook have also become more popular than ever. However, the reality is that under the exposure of this new internet era, our private information is no longer as safe as we thought before. While the online privacy issues have been raised by many experts and professions in recent years, there are still many people who are not aware of these issues.</p>
							<p>For the concept, I would like to create a website that will provide the explicit information about the internet privacy, including how user data is transmitted and monitored . In order to let the users to understand the topic – online privacy issues, the website will illustrate things like data transmission, internet monitoring, and personal online information protection. The website will allow users to discuss and share their own experience on internet privacy anonymously as well. The main purpose of creating this website is to inform internet users about the potential risk of posting their personal information online and the protection of their personal details. There is no doubt that many users also do not care about their online privacy or simply think this is not a big issue for them, but for the organisations who has been monitoring or taking users personal online data have gained a huge profit from it. Some companies purely just want to improve their product and user experience when they analyse user online data monitor monitor their activities; some organisations just want to make profits out of their user information. Neither of them should be allowed unless the users have genuinely agreed. There are of course many similar websites are talking about internet privacy but those topics are not integrated and it feels like they are all over the place. Therefore, this website will collect and integrate all relevant information together in order to give users a full experience and completed knowledge of internet privacy. In terms of the style, this website will use mostly black and white because they can represent and reflect the words ‘private’ and ‘unexposed’, which indicates personal information should not be exposed and used by other people without their permissions.</p>

							<!-- <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
							
							<p>The decision of creating an internet privacy related website was inspired by the increasing reports of internet privacy breaches. These reports are often referring to the cause of lack of cautious on their personal online information. However, there are also some examples indicate that collecting and analysing user data by companies like Facebook and twitter is an inevitable consequence of being an internet user. This is simply because you have to agree their term of service in order to actually use their service, without even talking about how many users would actually read the term of service. There are many reasons why organizations have started collecting data or monitoring activities. Some reasons are for improving their user experience and others are for its personal benefits, or even for the political reasons. There are several types of online privacy issues including web tracking, data collection, public Wi-Fi, government spying and identity theft.</p>
